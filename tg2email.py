# --- Importing Necessary Libraries And Files ---

# Import the load_dotenv function from the python-dotenv library. This function loads environment variables from a .env file into the system's environment. 
# Reference: https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv

# Import the Update class from Telegram library. Represents an incoming update (e.g.: a message).
# Reference: https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/en/v20.7/telegram.update.html

# Import necessary components from telegram.ext (the main module for building bots).
# Application: The core class that runs the bot.
# CommandHandler: Handles messages starting with '/' commands.
# MessageHandler: Handles regular messages based on filters.
# filters: Used to filter incoming messages (e.g., only handle documents).
# CallbackContext: A dictionary-like object to store and share bot/user data.
